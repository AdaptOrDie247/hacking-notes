# Install Required Tools

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc gcc-multilib checksec ltrace strace

gcc:          Compile C binaries
gcc-multilib: Compile 32-bit C binaries
checksec:     Check binary protections (stack canary, etc.)
ltrace:       Trace program execution (local)
strace:       Trace program execution (remote)
```

# Compile Binary for Testing

```
Check actual binary first with checksec to determine protections.
checksec --file=filename

gcc srcfile.c -o dstfilename -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -m32 -no-pie
```

# Exploitation

sh over bash
```
bash has protections in place to prevent privesc.
/bin/sh does not.
E.g., Overflow stack var passed to execve call as root with /bin/bash does not privesc, /bin/sh does.
```
