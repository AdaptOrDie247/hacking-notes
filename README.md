# Hacking Notes

My personal hacking notes learned from penetration testing.

# Important

These notes must be viewed using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for correct formatting.

# Side Note

I originally underestimated the amount of notes I would take. This has resulted in my notes organization not scaling well. I'm currently in the process or re-organizing my notes.
