# Hacking Notes

My personal hacking notes learned from penetration testing.

# Important

These notes must be viewed using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for correct formatting.

# Side Note

I was intentionally not strict with my organization in terms of having everything precisely categorized. This was for efficiency of access, ironically. Strict categorization can actually separate data that is easier to understand when it is grouped together, even if it is not in the exact correct place or reduced into components to eliminate redundancy.

Basically, these notes are for me, haha. If you find them helpful, that's awesome too.
